# Client-Side-WebDev  
Spring 2022 Web Development Class Work and Final Project  
To Locate Final Project: www/project  
Much of the website was produced with 1920 x 1080 resolution screens running 125% scale, which seems to be a relatively common standard for Windows machines.  
Because of this it may look discombobulated or cryptic on other resolutions or configurations.  
Hoping to find the time to make the website look more professional and run correctly and to scale on all resolutions, However currently have a large 
  workload at university.
